# Agents Experiments

Agents Experiments is a personal playground for exploring the capabilities of modern AI agents.

This repository contains small projects, prototypes, and research experiments ranging from simple conversational agents to multi-layer systems that analyze and interact like humans.

The goal is to learn, test, and build intelligent applications that leverage AI models, embeddings, and other tools to enable natural, context-aware interactions.
