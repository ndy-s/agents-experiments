# OpenAI Experiments

OpenAI Experiments is a personal playground for exploring the capabilities of OpenAI's API.

This repository contains small projects, prototypes, and research experiments from simple chat interactions to multi-layer bots that analyze conversations like humans.

The goal is to learn, test, and build intelligent applications that use GPT models, embeddings, and other AI tools to simulate natural, context-aware interactions.
